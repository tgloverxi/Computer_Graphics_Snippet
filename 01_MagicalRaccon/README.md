- Introduction

Perform the basic transformation on the vertex and fragment shaders in order to build a 'raccon play a ball' scene.

- Instruction

1. Open the 'A1.html' in the browser

2. 
    - Effect1: When you press 4 (rcState == 4):
The raccoon will change the scale and rotate with the time.
**Tried to use clock structue and Date.now() to manage time, but neither of them successed. Thus, manually set up the time variable. Need to improve this part.

    - Effect2: When you press 5 (rcState == 5):
The color of the raccon will change over time.

    - Effect3: When you press 6 (rcState == 6):
The raccon will deform to make a sin wave (vertically) over time.

    - Effect4: When you press 7 (rcState == 7):
The raccoon will explode along face normal.
